Pharmacy Stock DB
A MERN Stack Application for Pharmacy Inventory Management

Overview
Pharmacy Stock DB is a robust MERN stack application designed to efficiently manage pharmacy inventory. It provides a user-friendly interface to track stock levels, reorder supplies, and generate reports.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js and Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Cloud Platform: AWS
Deployment Process
1. Development:

Developers commit code changes to the main branch of the GitHub repository.
GitHub Actions triggers the build and test pipeline.
2. Build and Test:

The code is built and linted.
Unit and integration tests are executed.
The React frontend is built and optimized.
3. Deployment to Test Environment:

The built application is deployed to an AWS environment (e.g., AWS Amplify or AWS Elastic Beanstalk).
The deployment is automatically triggered by the CI/CD pipeline.
4. Manual Approval:

The deployment to the production environment is paused at the test stage.
A Change Advisory Board (CAB) meeting is scheduled to review the changes.
Upon approval from the CAB, the deployment proceeds to the production environment.
5. Production Deployment:

The approved changes are deployed to the production environment.
Monitoring and logging are set up to track application performance and errors.
Deployment using AWS CDK
1. Initialize a CDK Project:

Bash
cdk init app --language javascript
Use code with caution.

2. Define the CDK Stack:
Create a CDK stack to define the infrastructure resources:

JavaScript
// ... (import necessary modules)

class PharmacyStockDbStack extends Construct {
    constructor(scope, id, props) {
        super(scope, id, props);

        // ... (define API Gateway, Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables, etc.)

        // Configure pipeline for deployment
        const pipeline = new Pipeline(this, 'Pipeline');

        // ... (define stages: Source, Build, Test, and Production)

        // For the Production stage, add manual approval step
        pipeline.addStage(new ManualApprovalStage(this, 'ManualApproval'));

        // ... (configure deployment to production)
    }
}
Use code with caution.

3. Deploy the Stack:

Bash
cdk deploy PharmacyStockDbStack
Use code with caution.

Additional Considerations
Security:
Implement robust security measures, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
Regularly scan for vulnerabilities and apply security patches.
Performance:
Optimize database queries and API responses.
Implement caching strategies to reduce load.
Monitor application performance and identify bottlenecks.
Scalability:
Design the application to handle increasing load.
Use auto-scaling features to adjust resources dynamically.
Monitoring and Logging:
Set up monitoring and logging to track application health and performance.
Use tools like CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray.
By following these guidelines and leveraging AWS CDK, you can efficiently deploy and manage your Pharmacy Stock DB application.
